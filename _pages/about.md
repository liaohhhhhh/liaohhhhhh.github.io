<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I‚Äôm currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Integrated Circuits (School of Information Science and Electronic Engineering), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of <a href="https://yuwangsjtu.github.io/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Yu Wang</a>. I received my B.E. in Information Engineering from the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, also at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

üî¨ I‚Äôm passionate about combining AI with real-world applications, especially in medical and clinical domains. My research focuses on:

‚Ä¢	Large Language Models (LLMs)

‚Ä¢	Clinical Natural Language Processing (Clinical NLP)

üìö You can find my publications on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ErjimggAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>.
